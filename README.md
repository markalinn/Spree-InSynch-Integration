SpreeInsynchIntegration
=======================

Spree integration with default tables provided by ROI's team when setting up MAS integration with their InSynch module ( http://www.roi-consulting.com/proinsynch.htm ).

Developed and currently only tested with Spree 0.60.1.  Mainly just allows selection of SKU currently.  Still need to do all the order processing pieces.
